# AISA Study Project ML Deployment Options

## Deployment Tools

* Frameworks

  * [AWS Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)
    * not much customization available
    * can be used only with AWS ecosystem

## Criteria

**“COMPARISON TABLE FOR AWS SAGEMAKER AND HEROKU”** (R. V. Kulkarni, A. Thakur, S. Nalbalwar, S. Shah and S. Chordia, "Exploring Scalable and Efficient Deployment of Machine Learning Models: A Comparative Analysis of Amazon SageMaker and Heroku," 2023 International Conference on Information Technology (ICIT), Amman, Jordan, 2023, pp. 746-751, doi: 10.1109/ICIT58056.2023.10225793.):

## Integrate with our tools

- Basecamp
- GitLab
- bwCloud
- Overleaf

## Test and Deploy

Do we need to test any code?

---

## Topic

Focus: comparing tools for deployment of models.

Source: literature study, major selling points of a tool, other comparisons/independent reviews, come up by ourselves.

**Initialization: List of tools and criteria for comparison.

Size of Criteria: depends, expectation 10-20.

Evaluate ease of deployment: use trial/evaluation programms like bwCloud, evaluate tutorials or experience reports, hands-on evaluation with limited number of options for manageable scope.
