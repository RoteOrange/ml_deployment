## Criteria

## Integrate with your tools

- Basecamp
- GitLab
- bwCloud
- Overleaf

## Test and Deploy

Do we need to test any code?

## Topic

Focus: comparing tools for deployment of models.

Source: literatures study, major selling points of a tool, other comparisons/independent reviews, come up by ourselves.

Initialization: List of tools and criteria for comparison.

Size of Criteria: depends, expectation 10-20.

Evaluate ease of deployment: use trial/evaluation programms like bwCloud, evaluate tutorials or experience reports, hands-on evaluation with limited number of options for manageable scope.
