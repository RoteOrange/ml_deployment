“Fig. 1. Deployability dimensions along ML pipeline steps in production.” ([Heymann et al., 2023, p. 36](zotero://select/groups/5281887/items/WMMAXYY4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5281887/items/VWGB29WY?page=5&annotation=QLL9STVH))

## Integrate with your tools

- Basecamp
- GitLab
- bwCloud
- Overleaf

## Test and Deploy

Do we need to test any code?

---


## Topic

Focus: comparing tools for deployment of models.

Source: literatures study, major selling points of a tool, other comparisons/independent reviews, come up by ourselves.

Initialization: List of tools and criteria for comparison.

Size of Criteria: depends, expectation 10-20.

Evaluate ease of deployment: use trial/evaluation programms like bwCloud, evaluate tutorials or experience reports, hands-on evaluation with limited number of options for manageable scope.
