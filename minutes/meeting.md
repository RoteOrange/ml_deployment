# AISA Study Project ML Deployment Options: Meeting minutes

## 2023.11.23

### TOP1: Criterien

* The criterien that listed were for ML Pipeline, not for ML Deployment.

### TOP2: Deployment Tools

### TOP3: Organizational

* Suggestions about next to-do:
  * A study design needs to be formulated
  * Review (grey) literatures
  * A timeline would be nice to have.

### TOP1: Study Design

### TOP2: Ceiterien

**Some of the criteria are descriptive and some are quantitative, how to balance them and add them to the final table?**

Categorize and map them to some tags that are redundant. Some encyclopedic lists use footnotes at the end for lengthy explanations. Similar to a command line interface, using symbols, etc

**These standards only apply to the production field, do they also apply to our research?**

Our research focuses on deploying ML models in production to a good standard, so it applies to our project.

**Is the inclusion of preprints problematic?**

it's okay to use them. One reason to use peer review is to ensure the quality of a paper as long as it is presented at a conference.

**How do you print a huge list on a poster?**

Multiple tables, horizontal patterns, and the most important criteria.

### TOP3: Deployment Test

**Are we going to do deployment testing?**

Fundamentally, getting some data for the standard is a good thing, it can easily take a long time, and we should be able to get some resources. If we find content that meets the criteria, we evaluate it; if it's not very important and is just an option, we don't evaluate it.

**How to deal with competing research findings?**

Ideally, if we see the results of the competition, we should have some responsive explanation for it.

There is very little research on this kind of comparative analysis.

**How do you solve the time frame problem? What if suddenly the topic changes dramatically during the course of the research?**

We did so at that time.

**Future work on the project?**

Practical approach to validate theoretical analysis

Conduct case studies using the tools found. Investigate gaps, practitioners, how to adapt to this work.

**Makus vacation 23.12-12.01, next two meetings will be canceled.**
