### TOP2: Deployment Tools

### TOP3: Organizational

* Suggestions about next to-do:
  * A study design needs to be formulated
  * Review (grey) literatures
  * A timeline would be nice to have.

### TOP1: Study Design

### TOP2: Ceiterien

**Some of the criteria are descriptive and some are quantitative, how to balance them and add them to the final table?**

Categorize and map them to some tags that are redundant. Some encyclopedic lists use footnotes at the end for lengthy explanations. Similar to a command line interface, using symbols, etc

**These standards only apply to the production field, do they also apply to our research?**

Our research focuses on deploying ML models in production to a good standard, so it applies to our project.

**Is the inclusion of preprints problematic?**

it's okay to use them. One reason to use peer review is to ensure the quality of a paper as long as it is presented at a conference.

**How do you print a huge list on a poster?**

Multiple tables, horizontal patterns, and the most important criteria.

### TOP3: Deployment Test

**Are we going to do deployment testing?**

Fundamentally, getting some data for the standard is a good thing, it can easily take a long time, and we should be able to get some resources. If we find content that meets the criteria, we evaluate it; if it's not very important and is just an option, we don't evaluate it.

**How to deal with competing research findings?**

Ideally, if we see the results of the competition, we should have some responsive explanation for it.

There is very little research on this kind of comparative analysis.

**How do you solve the time frame problem? What if suddenly the topic changes dramatically during the course of the research?**

We did so at that time.

**Future work on the project?**

Practical approach to validate theoretical analysis

Conduct case studies using the tools found. Investigate gaps, practitioners, how to adapt to this work.

**Makus vacation 23.12-12.01, next two meetings will be canceled.**

TOP1: Study Design

we can keep with this format, current: setting the size, not specific requirement about it, on 02.02.24 we have to present it, before monday next week alternatively, evaluate the options based on the criteria, seperate the work. find a day for the poster, Friday 13:00 sit together

Thursday evening, finalize the content draft, sned to markus - friday morning markus read - friday evening doing the poster.

starts at 3 pm. ca. 90min. 3hours in total at poster in the first 30min indoor room150 uni street34 building

find balance between the bread? don#t cehckt other source to comferm, ?better do throughful analysis than adding another one?

don#t have too long list of sources, a medium number of criteria and sources, we don#t need to add in everything

TOP2: Criteria

2 - 4 better as 1, combine them, three point system? wheneve2,3 complete, 4 is complete.  ease of use, time etc. would be difficult without doing deployment, ease of installation, can the tool be setup locally? how easy it is to be setup?

suggestions: good number of criteria.

TOP3: Options

in model serving section looks applicable for us, we can say according the website... as a datasource, distibution of options
